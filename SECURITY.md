# Security Considerations for FROST-Golang

This document outlines important security considerations for the FROST-Golang library, particularly regarding timing attacks and side-channel vulnerabilities.

## Overview

The FROST-Golang library implements the Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) signature scheme. While the library has been designed with security in mind, there are several important considerations for production deployments.

## Known Security Limitations

### 1. Non-Constant-Time Operations in Secp256k1 Implementation

**Issue**: The secp256k1 curve implementation uses the btcec v2 library, which employs non-constant-time operations for performance reasons.

**Affected Operations**:
- Scalar inversion (`InverseValNonConst`)
- Point addition (`AddNonConst`) 
- Scalar multiplication (`ScalarMultNonConst`)

**Risk Level**: Medium to High (depending on deployment environment)

**Attack Vector**: Timing attacks where an attacker can measure the execution time of cryptographic operations to infer information about secret values (private keys, nonces, etc.).

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Network-Level Protection**: Deploy in environments where timing measurements are difficult (e.g., behind load balancers, with network jitter)

2. **Operational Countermeasures**:
   - **Avoid random delays**: Random delays are generally ineffective and can introduce new side-channels
   - Use constant-time curve implementations when available (limited in secp256k1)
   - Implement blinding techniques for sensitive operations
   - Consider using Ed25519 curve which has better constant-time properties

3. **Alternative Implementations**: For high-security environments, consider:
   - Using the Ed25519 curve implementation (which uses `filippo.io/edwards25519`)
   - Implementing additional blinding techniques
   - Using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key operations

### 2. BLS Binding Verification (RESOLVED)

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - BLS binding verification has been fully implemented.

The `VerifyBLSBinding` function now properly validates that FROST key shares are correctly bound to BLS keys using zero-knowledge proofs.

### 3. Deterministic Nonce Generation

**Current State**: The library uses `crypto/rand` for nonce generation, which is cryptographically secure.

**Recommendation**: For enhanced security and reproducibility, consider implementing RFC6979 deterministic nonces:

```go
// Example of how to implement deterministic nonces
func generateDeterministicNonce(privateKey []byte, message []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    // Use RFC6979 HMAC-based deterministic nonce generation
    // This eliminates dependency on system randomness quality
    return rfc6979.GenerateNonce(privateKey, message, sha256.New)
}
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate all inputs, especially:
   - Participant counts and thresholds
   - Public keys and signatures
   - BLS binding proofs

2. **Memory Management**: 
   - Use `Zeroize()` methods to clear sensitive data
   - Avoid logging or serializing secret values
   - Be careful with error messages that might leak information

3. **Audit Events**: Use the built-in audit system but ensure:
   - No secrets are included in audit logs
   - Audit events are properly secured and monitored

### For Operators

1. **Environment Security**:
   - Deploy in environments with limited timing attack surface
   - Use network-level protections (load balancers, CDNs)
   - Monitor for unusual timing patterns

2. **Key Management**:
   - Use proper key derivation and storage
   - Implement key rotation procedures
   - Consider hardware security modules for high-value keys

3. **Network Security**:
   - Use TLS for all communications
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Monitor for replay attacks and message tampering

## Curve-Specific Recommendations

### Secp256k1
- **Use Case**: Bitcoin, Ethereum compatibility
- **Security**: Non-constant-time operations present timing attack risk
- **Mitigation**: Deploy with network-level protections, consider blinding

### Ed25519  
- **Use Case**: General purpose, high security requirements
- **Security**: Constant-time implementation, better side-channel resistance
- **Recommendation**: Preferred for new deployments requiring maximum security

## Testing and Validation

### Security Testing Checklist

- [ ] Fuzz testing of all input parsing functions
- [ ] Timing analysis of cryptographic operations
- [ ] Memory leak detection and secret zeroization verification
- [ ] Network protocol security testing
- [ ] BLS binding proof validation testing

### Recommended Tools

1. **Static Analysis**: Use tools like `gosec` and `staticcheck`
2. **Fuzzing**: Implement Go's built-in fuzzing for input validation
3. **Timing Analysis**: Use tools like `dudect` for timing attack detection
4. **Memory Analysis**: Use `valgrind` or similar tools for memory safety

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in FROST-Golang:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@frost-golang.dev
3. Include detailed reproduction steps and impact assessment
4. Allow reasonable time for response and patching

## Version-Specific Security Notes
